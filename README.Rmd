Currently this is just a "WIP" as we explore and gather requirements of the project. There are some [notes](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/blob/master/notes/project_planning.md) to read.

This is a [geopumber](https://github.com/ATFutures/geoplumber) app. That means it is an R powered backend API (think Flask in Python) and a ReactJS front end.

To build, from an R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_build()
```

Before you run the app: 
* you will need some preprocessed data, an RDS called "ac_joined_wy_2009-2017.Rds".
* you will need a Mapbox API key (will see if we can remove this) in `.env.local` file using variable name:
`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'API_KEY'`

Then you can run
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_plumb()
```

visit `localhost:8000`

or just run the front using: `npm i & npm start`

## deploy with docker
Repo contains Dockerfile for production.
